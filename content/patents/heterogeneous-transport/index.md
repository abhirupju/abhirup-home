abstract: >-
  We propose a framework to automatically detect when a user leaves her
  workstation using Bluetooth signal strength between her workstation and the
  phone. Upon detecting motion, the framework transfers contexts of the active
  applications in the workstation to the phone, for example, URL and timing of a
  Youtube video being watched.
