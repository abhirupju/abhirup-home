  It is difficult to continually update private machine learning models with new
  data while maintaining privacy. Data incur increasing privacy loss â€“ as
  measured by differential privacy - when they are used in repeated
  computations. In this paper, we describe regularized empirical risk
  minimization algorithms that continually release models for a recent window of
  data. One version of the algorithm uses the entire data history to improve the
  model for the recent window. The second version uses a sliding window of
  constant size to improve the model, ensuring more relevant models in case of
  evolving data. The algorithms operate in the framework of stochastic gradient
  descent. We prove that even with releasing a model at each time-step over an
  infinite time horizon, the privacy cost of any data point is bounded by a
  constant \(\epsilon\) differential privacy, and the accuracy of the output
  models are close to optimal. Experiments on MNIST and Arxiv publications data
  show results consistent with the theory.
