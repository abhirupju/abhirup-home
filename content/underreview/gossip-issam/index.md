  Training machine learning models on sensing data from edge devices has become
  ubiquitous across application domains. A gossip learning system keeps the data
  local to the origin devices and trains machine learning models where the
  devices collaborate with others using peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. While
  today's mobile phones and wearable devices are the primary sources of personal
  sensing data, their computing and communication facilities make gossip
  learning a practical possibility. Although recent literature has identified
  gossip learning as an efficient and private system, this paper, for the first
  time, evaluates it on real mobile phones with peer-to-peer communication. We
  use 3 Android phones to learn an image classifier using the Cifar10 dataset.
  Our system performance metrics evaluation identified memory as the bottleneck.
  We also discuss the challenges of implementing a gossip learning system. Our
  framework is a necessary step toward making gossip learning systems a reality
