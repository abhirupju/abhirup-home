  Impairment of navigation is one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD), but to date, studies have involved proxy tests of navigation
  rather than studies of real-life behaviour. Here we use GPS tracking to
  measure ecological outdoor behaviour in AD. The aim was to use data-driven
  machine learning approaches to explore spatial metrics within real-life
  navigational traces that discriminate AD patients from controls. 15 AD
  patients and 18 controls underwent tracking of their outdoor navigation over
  two weeks. Three kinds of spatiotemporal features of segments were extracted,
  characterising the mobility domain (entropy, segment similarity, distance from
  home), spatial shape (total turning angle, segment complexity), and temporal
  characteristics (stop duration). Patients significantly differed from controls
  on entropy, segment similarity, and distance from home. Graph-based analyses
  yielded preliminary data indicating that topological features assessing the
  connectivity of visited locations may also differentiate patients from
  controls. In conclusion, our results show that specific outdoor navigation
  features discriminate AD patients from controls, which has significant
  implications for future AD diagnostics, outcome measures and interventions.
  Furthermore, this work illustrates how wearables-based sensing of everyday
  behaviour may be used to deliver ecologically-valid digital biomarkers of AD
  pathophysiology.

  This is the first paper showing that features extracted from outdoor mobility
  can detect whether a person will have Alzheimer's Disease.
