abstract: >-
  Major interventions have been introduced worldwide to slow down the spread of
  the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Large scale lockdown of human movements are effective in
  reducing the spread, but they come at a cost of significantly limited societal
  functions. We show that natural human movements are statistically diverse, and
  the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of
  active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on
  these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak
  infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social
  activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real
  human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from
  multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to
  broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted
  based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance
  between pandemic control and regular social activities.

  Human mobility has a high diversity and mobility interventions that focus on
  protecting the most active individuals and most popular venues can
  significantly reduce the infection while retaining high levels of social
  activity.
