abstract: Publishing data from IoT devices raises concerns of leaking sensitive
  information. In this paper we consider the scenario of publishing data on
  events with timestamps. We formulate three privacy issues, namely, whether one
  can tell if an event happened or not; whether one can nail down the timestamp
  of an event within a given time interval; and whether one can infer the
  relative order of any two nearby events. We show that perturbation of event
  timestamps or adding fake events following carefully chosen distributions can
  address these privacy concerns. We present a rigorous study of privately
  publishing discrete event timestamps with privacy guarantees under the
  Pufferfish privacy framework. We also conduct extensive experiments to
  evaluate utility of the modified time series with real world location checkin
  and app usage data. Our mechanisms preserve the statistical utility of event
  data which are suitable for aggregate queries.
