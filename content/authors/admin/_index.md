I design privacy-preserving machine learning systems to extract abstract knowledge from massive and noisy spatio-temporal sensing data recorded in edge devices like mobile phones. Currently, I'm interested in fully decentralized machine learning systems for edge devices. I use tools from Computational Geometry, Algebraic Topology, Data Mining, Statistics, and Machine Learning.

Currently, I am part of the [Mobile Systems Research Lab](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge. I am working on the MEDEA project funded by the Wellcome Trust to detect Alzheimer's disease using outdoor mobility and sleep data. I got my PhD in Sep-2019 from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh under [Dr Rik Sarkar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) in "Machine Learning and Privacy Preserving Algorithms for Spatial and Temporal Sensing". I was a Research Associate in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under [Dr Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/) (till Sep-2020).
