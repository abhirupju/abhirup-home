I﻿  am an  Assistant Professor at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx), [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) and a visiting researcher at the [Mobile Systems Research Lab](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge.

My interest is to learn sensing data recorded in phones and wearables. In particular, building systems to collaboratively learn in a resource efficient and privacy preserving way using Federated Learning and fully distributed Gossip Learning. I'm interested in various types of applications: graph analysis, mobile-health, and mobility.

- Mar-2022: I have organized a workshop on [Using Mobiles and Wearables for Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/events/using-mobiles-and-wearables-public-health) in association with [Cambridge Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/) and [Precision Health Initiative](https://www.precisionhealth.cam.ac.uk/).


<!-- I was a Senior Research Associate at the [Mobile Systems Research Lab](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html)Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge under [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/).

 I worked on detecting Alzheimer's disease using outdoor mobility and sleep data. I got my PhD in 2019 from the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh under [Dr Rik Sarkar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) in "Machine Learning and Privacy Preserving Algorithms for Spatial and Temporal Sensing". I was also a Research Associate in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under [Dr Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/).

**Workshop:** I  have organized  the workshop on [Using Mobiles and Wearables for Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/events/using-mobiles-and-wearables-public-health) in association with [Cambridge Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/) and [Precision Health Initiative](https://www.precisionhealth.cam.ac.uk/).
