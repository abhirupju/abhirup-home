I am primarily interested in learning abstract knowledge from the sensing data recorded in so-called smart end devices like phones and wearables. In particular, my current focus is on building systems to collaboratively learn on the end-devices in an resource efficient and privacy preserving way in the light of Federated Learning and fully distributed Gossip Learning.

Currently, I am a Senior Research Associate at the [Mobile Systems Research Lab](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge. I am working on the MEDEA project funded by the Wellcome Trust to detect Alzheimer's disease using outdoor mobility and sleep data. I got my PhD in 2019 from the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh under [Dr Rik Sarkar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) in "Machine Learning and Privacy Preserving Algorithms for Spatial and Temporal Sensing". I was a Research Associate in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under [Dr Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/) (till 2020).

Currently I'm organizing a workshop on [Using Mobiles and Wearables for Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/events/using-mobiles-and-wearables-public-health) in association with Cambridge Public Health and [Precision Health Initiative](https://www.precisionhealth.cam.ac.uk/). This is a free but pre-registration based in-person event in the William Gates Building, West Cambridge.
