I﻿  am an  Assistant Professor at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx), [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) I'll soon start to look for PhD students. Please contact me if you are interested.

I am primarily interested in learning from the sensing data recorded in phones and wearables. In particular, my current focus is on building systems to collaboratively learn in an resource efficient and privacy preserving way in the light of Federated Learning and fully distributed Gossip Learning. I'm interested in various types of applications: mobility, graph analysis, and mobile-health.

I was a Senior Research Associate at the [Mobile Systems Research Lab](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html)Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge under [Prof. Cecilia Mascolo](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cm542/).

I worked on detecting Alzheimer's disease using outdoor mobility and sleep data. I got my PhD in 2019 from the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh under [Dr Rik Sarkar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) in "Machine Learning and Privacy Preserving Algorithms for Spatial and Temporal Sensing". I was also a Research Associate in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under [Dr Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/).

**Workshop:** I  have organized  the workshop on [Using Mobiles and Wearables for Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/events/using-mobiles-and-wearables-public-health) in association with [Cambridge Public Health](https://www.cph.cam.ac.uk/) and [Precision Health Initiative](https://www.precisionhealth.cam.ac.uk/). The video for my talk is here:
