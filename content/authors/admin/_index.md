Currently, I am part of the [Mobile Systems Research Lab](https://mobile-systems.cl.cam.ac.uk/index.html) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge. I am working in the MEDEA project funded by the Wellcome Trust to detect Alzheimer's disease using outdoor mobility and sleep data.

I got my PhD in Sep-2019 from the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh under [Dr. Rik Sarkar](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/) in "Machine Learning and Privacy Preserving Algorithms for Spatial and Temporal Sensing" [[Thesis](https://abhirupju.github.io/Thesis_Abhirup.pdf)]. I was a Research Associate in the Department of Computing, Imperial College London under [Dr. Thomas Heinis](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/theinis/) (till Sep-2020).

My primary research interest is to design analysis and privacy-preserving algorithms using tools from topology, geometry, and statistics to infer abstract knowledge from massive and noisy spatio-temporal sensing data. I am also interested in Federated Learning problems and data management problems related to spatial and temporal data.
